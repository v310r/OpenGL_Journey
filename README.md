git clone --recursive https://github.com/v310r/LearnOpenGL.git -> to correctly clone the repo.

This repository is made only for learning purposes. Chapters were taken from https://learnopengl.com/. 

This whole project is an upgraded version of the source. Auxiliary classes were created in order to ease the usage of OpenGL API and understanding the whole concept.

If you'll find this useful, then I'd be glad.

Chapters are located in folder "chapters" ;-).


Only the windows platform is tested :-).

Have a nice day :D.

P.S. to generate the whole project, you'll need to run GenerateProjects.bat and  afterwards you should be ready to compile and run some project :D.
